this recipe has a hundred small variations! as to those who believe that my facts are wrong: the traditional milk tart (""melktert"" ) was made by cooks in olden days who made their own puff or flaky pastry, long before it was available frozen! the filling was then poured into the raw flaky pastry, sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon, and baked in a hot oven until puffy and golden brown. naturally this puff settled, like a souffle. to be at its best it was served warm. as time went by, cooks also used short pastry as well, but this needed to be blind-baked before the filling could be added and the final baking done.

the present-day shortcuts to be found in abundance in bakeries, shops and home industries in south africa are not really ""melktert"". melktert is not a custard poured into a crumbly crust and left to set. that must be the ""melktert"" my critics know and assume to be real milk tart. but those tarts/pies are the kind they used to push into people's faces in old slapstick movies.

after the two opinions posted, puzzled by the opinions, i checked all my older recipe books***, and found that all of them, in fact, said ""flaky pastry"" or ""puff pastry"", and all of them gave a recipe for a filling to be baked in the crust.

there are better recipes than this one ... you only need to find the one which works best for you. but a filling which is merely poured into a ready-made crust is not the real thing. and the tannies will be glad i rewrote this intro. they must be turning in their graves about those gloppy custard pies being sold as ""melktert"" these days!

fat, or;  just grill some fresh fish, or lightly bread the fresh fish fillet, and bake. you might even add a bit of sliced tomato, or a bit of vegetarian bacon (especially for twissis), a big slice of onion, chopped lettuce, spinach leaves, etc. whatever you chose,  just don't go into town. you don't have to now.  note: i am sorry this disappointed the chef by having you adding salt and cayenne pepper. please, anyone that knows my recipes, if you don't care for any of the items, please don't use them. it's ok by me to make this good for you and your family and to certainly not be wasting food. i am sorry this didn't work for you, but thanks for trying it.","['fish fillets', 'sour cream', 'mayonnaise', 'pickle juice', 'dill relish', 'cayenne pepper', 'garlic powder', 'salt', 'sugar', 'mustard powder', 'hamburger buns', 'american cheese', 'tomatoes', 'lettuce']",14

up with fresh snow.  of course by the time you finished playing in the back yard snow, getting thoroughly soaked through, mittens frozen to your fingers from making snow angels, the bowl was brimming over with the white stuff and your mom was telling you to come in.  if you were fortunate enough to have a mud room, you got to strip there but for those of us whose back door entered directly into the kitchen, you had to drop everything practically down to your bloomers on the newspaper your mom laid at the doorway.  so there you are almost buck naked, the blizzard wind is cold on your butt as you lean back against the cold door trying to get off those galoshes while simultaneously trying not to lose you grip on that bowl of snow.  but you didn't care.  it was coming!  snow ice cream.  man oh man.  your mom would make it up right in the bowl you brought it and then pour it into those old metal ice cube trays with the handle and freeze it.  but meanwhile you got to lick the bowl.  this was before the days we worried about samonella poisoning.  raw eggs in any kind of batter didn't mean cooties.  it just meant sweet sticky fingers wiping the bowl clean.  so here's a memory folks -- snow ice cream -- the way moms in the 1950s made it.  i also included the recipe at the end for the way nutrionists say is safer -- without eggs.  i haven't had it in years, yet the feelings, the smells, the sights, everything came flooding back in when i thought of it.  miss ya, mom!  love you so much.","['milk', 'egg', 'sugar', 'salt', 'pure vanilla extract', 'snow']",6
